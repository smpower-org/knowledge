<P>SuperMemo will often ask you to fill the missing part of a sentence. For example:</P>
<P align=center><span class="cloze">[...]</span> <strong><FONT size=5 color=0000ff>is the key weapon against forgetting</FONT></strong></P>
<P class="hint note"><strong>Hint</strong>: Try to remember what the key weapon against forgetting is. What word should replace the three dots?</p>
