<H3>Repetition is the key weapon against forgetting</H3>
<P>Everything you learn with SuperMemo will come back to you for review and repetition. Every day, you should review your scheduled portion of the learning material. Start with pressing <EM>Ctrl+L</EM>, or <EM>Enter</EM>, or choose <STRONG>Learn</STRONG> (if visible).</P>
<P>Press <EM>Enter</EM> to go from page to page. Sometimes, SuperMemo will ask you to grade yourself (e.g. <STRONG>Bright, Good, Pass, Fail</STRONG>, etc.). In such cases, click the grade that best reflects how well you remember.</P><FONT size=2>
